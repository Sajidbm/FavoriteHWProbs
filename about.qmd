My name is Sajid Bin Mahamud. I am a junior, math major at Reed College. As the title of this website suggests, I'll mostly be writing about some of my favorite HW problems from the math classes I have taken. Sometimes they'll include long expositions, sometimes they'll just be proofs and maybe a couple examples. But I expect to write often. If you have an interesting problem you'd like me to write about, send it over at sajidmahmud[sixty-one][at]gmail[dot]com.

*A note on the drawing above: The family of Giraffe Graphs was discovered on July 5, 2023 in Ames, Iowa. Last time I checked, they continue remain a happy family. It is the belief of this author that the youngest one has ADHD.*
