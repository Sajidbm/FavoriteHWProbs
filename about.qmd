<div id="justify">
   <p>My name is Sajid. I am a Junior, Math major at Reed College. As the title of this website suggests, I'll mostly be writing about some of my favorite HW problems from the math classes I have taken. Sometimes they'll include long expositions, sometimes they'll just be proofs and maybe a couple examples. But I expect to write often. If you have an interesting problem you'd like me to write about, send it over at sajidmahmud[sixty-one][at]gmail[dot]com.</p>
