# Introduction

In everyday mathematics, “close” is secretly political.

The usual absolute value on the rationals \(\mathbb{Q}\) rewards *small* numbers and punishes *big* ones: \(10^{-6}\) is closer to \(0\) than \(10^6\) is. Our geometry, analysis, and intuition are all built on this choice.

The \(p\)-adic numbers arise from a different vote on what “small” should mean. Instead of caring about the size of a rational number as a real quantity, we care about how divisible it is by a fixed prime \(p\). Numbers with many factors of \(p\) are declared “tiny,” even if they look huge on the real number line.

This post is about how to formalize that idea:

- first through metrics, Cauchy sequences, and completions;
- then by defining a new absolute value \(|\cdot|_p\) on \(\mathbb{Q}\);
- and finally by showing the algebraic picture via inverse limits and power series in \(p\).

By the end, \(\mathbb{Q}_p\) should feel like a natural parallel universe to the real numbers, built from the same rationals but with a radically different sense of distance.

# Cauchy sequences and completion

We start with the general idea of completing a metric space, because both the real numbers and the \(p\)-adic numbers arise from this construction.

## Metrics and Cauchy sequences

A **metric space** is a pair \((M,d)\) where \(M\) is a set and \(d:M\times M\to \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}\) satisfies:

1. \(d(x,y)=0\) iff \(x=y\),
2. \(d(x,y)=d(y,x)\),
3. \(d(x,z)\le d(x,y)+d(y,z)\) (triangle inequality).

A sequence \((x_n)_{n\ge 1}\) in \(M\) is **Cauchy** if
\[
\forall \varepsilon>0\;\exists N\ \text{s.t.}\ m,n\ge N \implies d(x_m,x_n)<\varepsilon.
\]
Intuitively, the terms eventually get arbitrarily close to each other, whether or not they converge to a point already in the space.

A metric space \((M,d)\) is **complete** if every Cauchy sequence converges in \(M\).

## Completion: from \(\mathbb{Q}\) to \(\mathbb{R}\)

The rationals \(\mathbb{Q}\) with the usual absolute value \(|x|\) form a metric space \((\mathbb{Q},|\cdot|)\) that is *not* complete. Classic example: a sequence of rational approximations to \(\sqrt{2}\) is Cauchy in \((\mathbb{Q},|\cdot|)\) but does not converge to a rational number.

There is a standard construction (via equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences) that associates to any metric space \((M,d)\) a **completion** \((\widehat M,\widehat d)\) together with an isometric embedding \(i:M\hookrightarrow\widehat M\) whose image is dense. For \((\mathbb{Q},|\cdot|)\), the completion is the real line \((\mathbb{R},|\cdot|)\).

The key idea for this post:

> If we change the metric on \(\mathbb{Q}\), we get a *different* completion.  
> For the usual absolute value we get \(\mathbb{R}\); for the \(p\)-adic absolute value we will get \(\mathbb{Q}_p\).

So we now need to define the \(p\)-adic absolute value.

# The \(p\)-adic valuation and absolute value

Fix a prime \(p\). The first ingredient is the **\(p\)-adic valuation**.

## The valuation \(\nu_p\) on integers and rationals

For a nonzero integer \(n\), write it uniquely as
\[
n = p^k \cdot m,
\]
where \(k\in\mathbb{Z}\) and \(m\in\mathbb{Z}\) is not divisible by \(p\). Then define
\[
\nu_p(n) := k,\qquad \nu_p(0) := \infty.
\]

For example, with \(p=5\):
- \(\nu_5(4)=0\) (no factor of 5),
- \(\nu_5(5)=1\),
- \(\nu_5(10)=1\),
- \(\nu_5(25)=2\),
- \(\nu_5(125)=3\),
- \(\nu_5(0)=\infty\).

Extend this to nonzero rationals by
\[
\nu_p\!\left(\frac{a}{b}\right) := \nu_p(a)-\nu_p(b),\quad a,b\in\mathbb{Z},\ b\neq 0.
\]
This makes sense because any rational can be written uniquely as a ratio of two integers up to a unit.

So \(\nu_p\) measures how many factors of \(p\) appear in a number: more factors of \(p\) means a **larger** valuation.

## The \(p\)-adic absolute value

From \(\nu_p\) we build the **\(p\)-adic absolute value**:
\[
|x|_p :=
\begin{cases}
p^{-\nu_p(x)}, & x\neq 0,\\
0, & x=0.
\end{cases}
\]

Two immediate consequences:

- If \(x\) is divisible by a high power of \(p\), then \(\nu_p(x)\) is large and positive, so \(|x|_p\) is **very small**.
- If \(p\) does not divide \(x\), then \(\nu_p(x)=0\) and \(|x|_p=1\).

Examples with \(p=5\):
\[
|25|_5 = 5^{-\nu_5(25)} = 5^{-2}=\frac{1}{25},\qquad
|4|_5 = 1,\qquad
\left|\frac{1}{125}\right|_5 = 5^{-\nu_5(1/125)} = 5^{-(-3)} = 5^3 = 125.
\]

Notice how “smallness” is inverted compared to the usual absolute value: \(25\) is *smaller* than \(4\) in the \(5\)-adic sense.

## The \(p\)-adic metric

Define the **\(p\)-adic metric** on \(\mathbb{Q}\) by
\[
d_p(x,y) := |x-y|_p.
\]

This is a genuine metric on \(\mathbb{Q}\):

- \(d_p(x,y)=0\) iff \(x=y\),
- symmetric in \(x,y\),
- and it satisfies a **strong** triangle inequality (ultrametric inequality), which we will state shortly.

Now we can consider Cauchy sequences with respect to \(d_p\), not the usual Euclidean distance.

# Intuition: what does “close” mean \(p\)-adically?

The \(p\)-adic notion of closeness is strange at first glance, so it helps to look at explicit sequences.

Take \(p=5\). Consider the sequence:
\[
a_n = 1 + 5 + 5^2 + \cdots + 5^n.
\]

In the usual absolute value \(|\cdot|\), the sequence \((a_n)\) diverges to \(+\infty\). But in the \(5\)-adic metric:

- The difference between successive terms is
  \[
  a_{n+1}-a_n = 5^{n+1}.
  \]
- The \(5\)-adic absolute value of this difference is
  \[
  |a_{n+1}-a_n|_5 = |5^{n+1}|_5 = 5^{-(n+1)} \longrightarrow 0
  \]
  as \(n\to\infty\).

So in \((\mathbb{Q},d_5)\), the terms of the sequence get closer and closer together: \((a_n)\) is Cauchy in the \(5\)-adic metric.

This is the central phenomenon: **adding more powers of \(p\) changes a number by less and less \(p\)-adically.** The “digits” in base \(p\) to the *left* (higher powers of \(p\)) become *less* important than the lower powers.

You can think of \(p\)-adic numbers as infinite base-\(p\) expansions extending indefinitely to the **left**:
\[
\cdots + b_3 p^3 + b_2 p^2 + b_1 p + b_0.
\]

The sequence \(a_n\) above converges to a \(5\)-adic number whose “digits” are all \(1\) in base 5:
\[
\cdots 11111\_5.
\]

# Ultrametric geometry

The \(p\)-adic absolute value satisfies a stronger inequality than the usual triangle inequality:
\[
|x+z|_p \le \max\{|x|_p,|z|_p\}.
\]

Consequently, the metric \(d_p(x,y)=|x-y|_p\) is an **ultrametric**:
\[
d_p(x,z) \le \max\{d_p(x,y),d_p(y,z)\} \quad\text{for all }x,y,z\in\mathbb{Q}.
\]

This geometry has some counterintuitive consequences:

- Every triangle is **isosceles**: at least two sides have the same length, and the third is no longer than those.
- Balls are both **open and closed** (“clopen”).
- If two balls intersect, one is contained in the other.

These properties make \(p\)-adic spaces feel totally unlike the real line, even though they start from the same underlying set of rationals.

# Completing \(\mathbb{Q}\) with respect to \(|\cdot|_p\)

We now repeat the real-number story with the new metric.

## Definition of \(\mathbb{Q}_p\)

Consider the metric space \((\mathbb{Q},d_p)\) with \(d_p(x,y)=|x-y|_p\). It is not complete: there are \(p\)-adic Cauchy sequences (like the geometric series above) that do not converge to a rational number.

**Definition.** The **field of \(p\)-adic numbers** \(\mathbb{Q}_p\) is the completion of \((\mathbb{Q},|\cdot|_p)\). Concretely, its elements are equivalence classes of \(p\)-adic Cauchy sequences of rationals, where two sequences are equivalent if their difference converges to \(0\) in the \(p\)-adic metric.

The field operations extend from \(\mathbb{Q}\) by performing them termwise on representatives of the equivalence classes. The metric extends to \(\mathbb{Q}_p\), making \((\mathbb{Q}_p,|\cdot|_p)\) a complete non-Archimedean valued field.

The embedding
\[
\iota:\mathbb{Q}\hookrightarrow \mathbb{Q}_p,\qquad x\mapsto \text{(constant sequence }x,x,x,\dots)
\]
is isometric and has dense image, just as \(\mathbb{Q}\) is dense in \(\mathbb{R}\).

# The algebraic construction of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\)

There is also a more “algebraic” way to see the \(p\)-adic world, via inverse limits and base-\(p\) expansions. This perspective is particularly nice for the **\(p\)-adic integers** \(\mathbb{Z}_p\).

## Compatible systems modulo \(p^n\)

For each \(n\ge 1\), consider the ring \(\mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z}\). For \(n\ge m\), there is a natural reduction map
\[
\mu_{nm}:\mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z} \longrightarrow \mathbb{Z}/p^m\mathbb{Z},\qquad
[a]_{p^n}\mapsto [a]_{p^m}.
\]

The family \(\{\mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z},\mu_{nm}\}\) forms a projective system. The **inverse limit**
\[
\varprojlim_n \mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z}
\]
consists of all sequences \((a_1,a_2,a_3,\dots)\) with
\[
a_n \in \mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z},\quad
\mu_{nm}(a_n)=a_m \text{ for all } n\ge m.
\]

In other words, a point of the inverse limit is a coherent system of residues modulo \(p, p^2, p^3,\dots\), all compatible under reduction.

**Definition.** The ring of **\(p\)-adic integers** \(\mathbb{Z}_p\) is defined as
\[
\mathbb{Z}_p := \varprojlim_n \mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z}.
\]

## Base-\(p\) expansions as power series

Each element of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\) can be written uniquely as an infinite series
\[
b = b_0 + b_1 p + b_2 p^2 + b_3 p^3 + \cdots
\]
with digits \(b_i\in\{0,1,\dots,p-1\}\).

Sketch of why:

- Start with a compatible system \((a_n)\) in the inverse limit.
- For each \(n\), choose a representative integer \(\tilde a_n\) of the class \(a_n\in\mathbb{Z}/p^n\mathbb{Z}\).
- Because of compatibility, we can choose the \(\tilde a_n\) so that
  \[
  \tilde a_n \equiv \tilde a_{n-1} \pmod{p^{n-1}}\quad\text{for all }n.
  \]
- Writing \(\tilde a_n\) in base \(p\),
  \[
  \tilde a_n = b_0 + b_1 p + \cdots + b_{n-1} p^{n-1},
  \]
  we see that the coefficients \(b_0,\dots,b_{n-1}\) stabilize as \(n\) grows, yielding an infinite sequence \((b_i)_{i\ge 0}\).

Conversely, given an infinite base-\(p\) expansion \(\sum_{i=0}^\infty b_i p^i\), we can truncate at level \(n\) to get an element modulo \(p^n\), and those truncations are compatible. So there is a bijection between \(\mathbb{Z}_p\) and the set of power series in \(p\) with coefficients in \(\{0,\dots,p-1\}\).

Under this identification:

- Ordinary integers \(\mathbb{Z}\subset \mathbb{Z}_p\) correspond to those power series with only finitely many nonzero digits \(b_i\).
- “Genuinely \(p\)-adic” integers have infinitely many nonzero digits to the left.

## From \(\mathbb{Z}_p\) to \(\mathbb{Q}_p\)

The field \(\mathbb{Q}_p\) is the field of fractions of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\):
\[
\mathbb{Q}_p = \mathrm{Frac}(\mathbb{Z}_p).
\]

Every nonzero \(x\in\mathbb{Q}_p\) can be written uniquely in the form
\[
x = p^k u,\quad k\in\mathbb{Z},\ u\in\mathbb{Z}_p^\times,
\]
where \(u\) is a \(p\)-adic unit (i.e. \(|u|_p=1\)). This reflects the valuation decomposition we started with: \(\nu_p(x)=k\).

The two constructions of \(\mathbb{Q}_p\)—completion of \((\mathbb{Q},|\cdot|_p)\) and field of fractions of \(\mathbb{Z}_p\)—agree, though proving this takes a bit of work.

# A worked taste: lifting roots \(p\)-adically

As a small application, let’s briefly see how \(p\)-adic methods solve polynomial equations.

Consider
\[
f(x)=x^2-2
\]
and the prime \(p=7\). There is no rational solution to \(x^2=2\), but in \(\mathbb{Q}_7\) we can look for a 7-adic root.

Step 1: find a solution modulo \(7\). Compute squares modulo 7:
\[
0^2\equiv 0,\ 
1^2\equiv 1,\ 
2^2\equiv 4,\ 
3^2\equiv 9\equiv 2,\ 
4^2\equiv 16\equiv 2,\ 
5^2\equiv 4,\ 
6^2\equiv 1\pmod{7}.
\]
So \(x\equiv 3\) and \(x\equiv 4\) are solutions of \(x^2\equiv 2\pmod{7}\).

Take \(x_1=3\). We try to lift this to a solution modulo \(7^2=49\) of the form
\[
x_2 = 3 + 7k,\quad k\in\mathbb{Z}.
\]
Compute
\[
x_2^2 = (3+7k)^2 = 9 + 42k + 49k^2
\equiv 9 + 42k \pmod{49}.
\]
We want \(x_2^2 \equiv 2\pmod{49}\), so
\[
9 + 42k \equiv 2 \pmod{49}
\quad\iff\quad
7 + 42k \equiv 0 \pmod{49}.
\]
Divide by 7:
\[
1 + 6k \equiv 0 \pmod{7}
\quad\iff\quad
6k \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\quad\iff\quad
k\equiv 1 \pmod{7}.
\]
Take \(k=1\), so \(x_2 = 3+7=10\). Then \(x_2^2\equiv 2\pmod{49}\).

This lifting process can be continued modulo \(7^3,7^4,\dots\), and in the limit it converges to a 7-adic number \(x\in\mathbb{Q}_7\) with \(x^2=2\). This is a concrete glimpse of what Hensel’s lemma does in general.

# Appendix: algebraic background (optional)

For convenience, here are compressed definitions of some algebraic notions that often appear in discussions of \(p\)-adic numbers and algebraic number theory.

## Groups

A **group** is a set \(G\) equipped with a binary operation \(\cdot:G\times G\to G\) such that:

1. **Associativity:** \((ab)c = a(bc)\) for all \(a,b,c\in G\).
2. **Identity element:** There exists \(e\in G\) s.t. \(ea=ae=a\) for all \(a\in G\).
3. **Inverses:** For each \(a\in G\) there exists \(a^{-1}\in G\) with \(aa^{-1}=a^{-1}a=e\).

If \(ab=ba\) for all \(a,b\in G\), the group is **abelian** (commutative).

## Rings and integral domains

A (commutative, unital) **ring** \(R\) is a set with two operations \(+\) and \(\cdot\) such that:

- \((R,+)\) is an abelian group (with identity \(0\)),
- \(\cdot\) is associative, has an identity element \(1\neq 0\),
- multiplication distributes over addition: \(a(b+c)=ab+ac\) and \((a+b)c=ac+bc\).

An element \(a\in R\) is a **zero divisor** if \(a\neq 0\) and there exists \(b\neq 0\) with \(ab=0\).

An **integral domain** is a commutative ring with \(1\neq 0\) and **no** zero divisors. Examples: \(\mathbb{Z}\), \(\mathbb{Z}[x]\), \(\mathbb{C}[x]\).

## Unique factorization domains

Let \(R\) be an integral domain.

An element \(u\in R\) is a **unit** if it has a multiplicative inverse in \(R\). An element \(p\in R\) is **irreducible** if it is nonzero, not a unit, and whenever \(p=ab\) with \(a,b\in R\), then either \(a\) or \(b\) is a unit.

The domain \(R\) is a **unique factorization domain (UFD)** if:

1. Every nonzero, nonunit element of \(R\) can be written as a finite product of irreducible elements.
2. This factorization is unique up to permutation and multiplication by units.

The integers \(\mathbb{Z}\) and the polynomial ring \(\mathbb{C}[x]\) are standard examples of UFDs. For \(p\)-adic number theory, the fact that \(\mathbb{Z}\) is a UFD underlies the clean behavior of the valuations \(\nu_p\) and the analogy between prime factors and “linear factors” of polynomials.

---

This gives a self-contained narrative: \(\mathbb{Q}_p\) as a completion of \(\mathbb{Q}\) with respect to a new metric, with an algebraic model via inverse limits and base-\(p\) expansions, and a small glimpse of how these numbers are used in practice. You can now drop this `.qmd` file into a Quarto project and tweak the tone or level of detail to taste.
