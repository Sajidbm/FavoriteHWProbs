On my [previous post](https://sajidbm.github.io/FavoriteHWProbs/posts/Summer-2024/), I claimed that upto $10$ vertices, the *conjecture 1.1* holds true. For better or worse, the claim isn't true. It turns out due to a classfication error (more on this later), I was unable to detect graphs that does disprove *conjecture 1.1*. With graphs found through the new algorithm, I have shown that *conjecture 1.1* is false. 

## Housekeeping

[Dr. Vanni Noferini](https://math.aalto.fi/~noferiv1/) and I are working on a graph theory project at Aalto University in Finland. I will first restate the conjecture we have been working on. 

Let $A \in M_{n\times n}(\mathbb{R})$. Define $$\mathrm{diag}(A): M_{n\times n} \to M_{n \times 1} \text{ where } \mathrm{diag}(A) = \{a_{ii}\}_{i=1}^{n}$$

***Conjecture 1.1:*** (False) *Let $G$ and $H$ be simple graphs, and $A$, $B$ be the corresponding adjacency matrices. Suppose there exists a unique permutation matrix $\pi$ such that for all $k\geq 0$ such that $$\mathrm{diag}(A^k) = \pi~ \mathrm{diag}(B^k)$$ Then $G$ and $H$ are isomorphic.*

*Lemma 1.2* tells us that we only needs to check for $1\leq k \leq n$ and with *Lemma 1.3* we have that it is enough to require $\pi = I$ for all $k$. 

## Counter Examples 

The counter examples to the *Conjecture 1.1* are a testament to the fact that despite two graphs having the same closed walks of all lengths, they might not be always isomorphic. This means that having complete knowledge of the closed walks of graphs alone does not determine its isomorphism class. This gives rise to this new class of graphs, which by my royal decree shall be named *closed walk defiant graphs* or CWDs.

Expectedly, the number CWDs are quite small: only $116$ out of $1,229,2182$ non-isomorphic graphs on $10$ vertices. Based on my present computation, for $11$ vertices, only $7738$ out of $1,018,997,864$ graphs are CWDs. So naturally, I am inclined to find out what happens to the relative ratio of closed walk defiant graphs to their obedient counterparts.

You can find the graph6 format of all the CWDs I found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zwHWlRQRbIH_zbz7XWBrzdTSEmxkUnPA?usp=sharing).  


## Strongly Regular Graph (SRG)

Following my conversation with Andries E. Brouwer, I found that strongly regular graphs constitute another class of CWDs. A strongly regular graph is characterized by the parameters $(n, k, \mu, \lambda)$ where $n$ is the number of vertices, $k$ is the degree of each vertex. To define $\mu$ and $\lambda$, let $x_i, x_j$ be rows (or columns) of the adjacency matrix $A$. Then: $\mu = \langle x_i, x_j \rangle$ when $i \not \sim j$ or the vertices $i$ and $j$ are not adjacent, and $\lambda = \langle x_i, x_j \rangle$  when $i \sim j$ or $i$ is adjacent to $j$. The first set of CWDs appear on $16$ vertices: $G$,$H$ that are non-isomorphic graphs with the same strongly regular parameter $(n, k, \mu, \lambda)$ and are closed walk equivalent graphs. Here the the first two strongly regular graphs that are closed walk defiant.

This leads one to ask: how many are there - distinct SRGs with the same parameters. 


## Appendix 
***Lemma 1.2:*** Let $A,B$ be real symmetric. There exists a fixed permutation matrix $\pi$ for all $k\geq 0$ such that $$\mathrm{diag}(A^k) = \pi~ \mathrm{diag}(B^k)$$ if and only if $$\mathrm{diag}(A^k) = \pi~ \mathrm{diag}(B^k) ~~~(\star)$$ for  $1\leq k \leq n$. 

***Lemma 1.3:*** $A$ and $B$ satisfy the diagonal criteria if and only if $\mathrm{diag}(M^k) = \mathrm{diag}(N^k)$ where $M,N$ are permutation similar to $A$ and $B$ respectively. 


[^1]: An algorithm that takes $O(n^k)$ time to run where $n$ is the size of the input and $k$ is a positive constant.

[^const]: The run time of the operation is independent of the size of input.

[^bounds]: In practical terms, on an $O(n^5)$ algorithm, if $n$ doubles, the amount of time it takes to solve the problem is $2^5 = 32$ times in proportion. On an $2^{((O\log n)^3)}$ algorithm the growth is quasi-polynomial. Meaning for $n=10,100,1000$, it respectively takes $2^7 = 128$ and $2^{19}$ times longer than the former. 

[^corr]: Due to a coding error, my algorithm was unable to detect counterexamples on $n=10$ vertices. This statement is no longer true following the fix.
