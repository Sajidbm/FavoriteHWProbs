This article was inspired by one of David Parkinson's Homework problems from the *Topics in Geometry* class. We talked about DeRahm Cohomology for the week and the problem illustrated simply how powerful the tool might be. The problem was intended to show an application of DeRahm Cohomology to the familar concepts of curl, divergence and gradient.

## The Problem 

To see the exact problem, look for *problem 3* [here](https://people.reed.edu/~davidp/341/hw/09hw.pdf). We won't consider the entire problem but will talk about a few parts to motivate the inquiry and perhaps give some food for thought for le curieux!


## Motivating the Problem 

If you need a primer on vector calculus, check the ([Appendix](#Vector_Field)). At first, let's look at an example[^diff]. We will consider the two different vector fields $\nu: \R^2- \{0\} \to \R^2$, and $v: \R^2 \to \R^2$ given by the same form [^func]: 

$$
v = \nu = \frac{-y }{x^2+y^2} ~ dx+ \frac{x }{x^2+y^2} ~ dy
$$

In physical terminology, given the vector field (say a force field), it is natural to ask if the field is conservative[^cons] and therefore has a potential function.


Finally, in vector calculus lingo, one asks if the line integral of $v$ along a smooth closed loop [^loop] $C: [0,1] \to \R^2$ is zero. All of these ask the same question. But despite $v$ and $\nu$ being the same function, having and not having a puncture in its domain determines if the field is guranteed to have a potential function (or if the form is guaranteed to be exact).

In the language of differential forms, one can ask if the form for the field $v$ (or $\nu$) is an exact form. 

Let's compute the line integral of $v$ along a closed circle $C:[0,1] \to \R^2$, given by $C(t) = (\cos 2 \pi t, \sin 2 \pi t)$: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \int_{C} v &= \int v \circ C (t)\\
                &= \int \frac{-(\sin 2\pi t) d(\sin)}{}
\end{aligned} 
$$

## Appendix

### Vector Field

A vector field is a vector-valued function that assigns a vector to each point of its domain. For example: consider the simple vector field $v: \R^2 \to \R^2$ given by: $v(x,y) = (x,y)$. Given any point $p=(x,y)$ it assigns the vector $(x,y)$ to p. A visual representation of the field is given by:

[^cons]: One of the reasons is to be able to talk about work done in moving an object from one point to the other without having to invoke double integrals.

[^diff]: We will use the differntial forms notation for vector fields. 

[^func]: Or function, if you like to think of vector fields as vector-valued functions.

[^loop]: A *smooth closed loop* $C:[0,1] \to \R^n$ is a curve in $\R^n$ where $C(0) = C(1)$, and $C'(t)$ is continious for all $t \in [0,1]$
