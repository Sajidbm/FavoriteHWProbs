Prove that for all $\\alpha$, there exists infinitely many $p$ and $q$ such that: $$0 < |\\alpha - \\frac{p}{q}| < \\frac{1}{q^2}$$\n\nThis was a problem on one of my real analysis homeworks, a few weeks after we started measure theory. On this part of the post, I'll discuss the general version of the theorem, give the proof of the case when $\\alpha$ is irrational [^1], and try to illustrate some cool geometric ideas lying underneath it's surface. *The Dirichlet's Approximation Theorem* is a fundamental result in Diophantine approximation [@Dirichlet]. It says that any real number has a sequence of 'good' rational approximations. You might be wondering why is it surprising given that we can always find *a* rational approximation of any real number. That is: given $\\epsilon>0$ and real number $\\alpha$, we can find rational number $r$ which is at least $\\epsilon$ close to $\\alpha$[^2]: $$|\\alpha - r| < \\epsilon$$  However, as we will soon find out, 'good' has a special meaning for us: it's what makes the theorem profoundly beautiful.\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n    \\alpha  &\\leq \\frac{p+q}{q}\\\\ &\\leq \\frac{p+1}{q}\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n3+3\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=2}\n```\n6\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n[^1]: The rational case is straightforward\n[^2]: This follows from the fact that rational numbers are dense in the real numbers.\n\n",
