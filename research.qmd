I have conducted research in a wide variety of fields including spectral graph theory, computational geometry, discrete and combinatorial geometry, and dynamical systems. 

## Current Projects

### [Online GPS spoofing detection algorithm](https://github.com/Sajidbm/Aerial-Data-Analysis)
- We may frame platform-agnostic GPS spoofing detection as an **online change-point detection** problem. This framework allows us to identify malignant interference without relying on rigid, deterministic signal thresholds.
- Standard deep learning approaches (e.g., LSTMs, Bayesian Neural Networks) are often computationally infeasible for the limited onboard resources of modern UAVs and autonomous vehicles.
- I am developing a lightweight, filtering-based inference framework. By monitoring the innovation sequence (residuals) of the state estimator, we can detect statistical deviations from the baseline operation in real-time.
- The algorithm maintains a dynamic estimate of the residual distribution over a moving window. Detection is triggered when the distribution undergoes a statistically significant regime shift, indicating a potential spoofing attack.

### [Error propagation and regime change detection in climate models](https://github.com/Sajidbm/Climate-Modelling)
- A critical bottleneck in climate modeling is **sub-grid scale parameterization**—accurately representing physical processes (e.g., cloud formation, turbulence) that occur at scales smaller than the model grid (typically 10-100 km).
- State-of-the-art approaches like **NeuralGCM** combine differentiable fluid dynamics solvers with neural networks to learn these sub-grid impacts from high-resolution data.
- My research investigates error propagation within these hybrid systems, specifically aiming to detect **regime changes** where the model drifts from physics based forecast.
- I utilize **Ensemble Kalman Filters (EnKF)** to track the covariance of the model state, using the filter's divergence as a diagnostic tool for identifying "unphysical" error growth or regime shifts. 

## Past Projects

### [Closed-walk matrices and cospectrality in graph spectra](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EgXXoDRa3cVX78nx1LN_WEuPK6CwHtDl/view)

- Many non-isomorphic graphs share the same adjacency spectrum, so understanding the typical size of cospectral equivalence classes matters for counting how many distinct spectra occur asymptotically.
- A natural route to lower bounds uses Godsil–McKay switching, which preserves spectrum, but the method does not automatically certify non-isomorphism, creating a bottleneck for rigorous class-size constructions.
- I proposed a finer equivalence relation based on the closed-walk matrix that records closed-walk counts across lengths.
- Using this framework, I constructed closed-walk-equivalent graph families under specific restrictions and developed simple algorithmic checks to find out when these constructions plausibly give rise to non-isomorphic examples.
- A central remaining challenge is to develop sufficient conditions that guarantee non-isomorphism inside these equivalence classes.
